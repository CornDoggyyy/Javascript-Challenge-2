# Javascript-Challenge-2
Dit was een Javascript Challenge voor DEV Donderdag.

Challenge: Look mom, my first shopping cart
- Create an array with products objects:
    The product has a name
    The product has a price
    The product has an image 'image/3.jpeg'

Here is the data:
- Playstation 5, 499, 'images/playstation-5.jpg'
- Cyberpunk 2049, 5, 'images/cyberpunk.jpg'
- Playstation Controller, 50, 'images/controller.jpg'

Now only grab one of these products
Now filter these products, only the ones with a price higher than 10 euro's.
